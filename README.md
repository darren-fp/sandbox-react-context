# Sandbox for React Context

Sandbox for experimenting with React Context

Implemented a custom React hook `useAutoFetchContext` that fetches data from api call on mount and stores it in context state if data does not exist. Does nothing if data exists. Returns an object `{data, error, loading}` from context object
